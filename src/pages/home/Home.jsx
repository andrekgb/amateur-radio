                                The range of these radios can be only local (inside the city, state or country) or global.&nbsp;
                                It all depends on the frequency used, antenna and especially the ionosphere conditions.&nbsp;
                                The ionosphere conditions are important because it "bounces" the radio signals back to earth. See image below:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                You can click to see the full image. We use what they call "low frequency".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since this type of frequencies depends so much on the ionosphere,&nbsp;
                                it's not considered reliable enough for commercial use. Thus these frequencies are used by&nbsp;
                                amateurs for experimentation and friendly communications.
                            </p>

                                These contacts, we also call it "QSO", are simply conversations via radio. Basically we
                                stop at a certain frequency and broadcast our presence. Other Amateur Radio Operators who listen to it can reply to the call.&nbsp;
                                They can be in the context of a friendly conversation, trying to get a contact with a specific country (with the objective of talking
                                to all the countries on the planet) or competitions (number of contacts x number of countries = final score).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These conversations can be via:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Audio:</b> To be able to establish a voice contact both station involved in the conversation need to have a good output power&nbsp;
                                        (watts) so both sides can completely understand all the nuances of the human voice. <a href={'https://youtu.be/p7pzlb5074c'} target={'_blank'}>Here's another example of it</a><br/><br/>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Morse Code:</b> Yep, people still use it. It's the most effective way of communication via Radio, without a computer because people&nbsp;
                                        hearing it do not need to understand all the nuances of the human voice. They just need to understand the "beep", thus making it possible&nbsp;
                                        for Amateur Radio Operators to use less power output and compromised antennas.
                                        Each letter of the alphabet has a sound. The amateur Radio Operator listens and writes down the letters, or just keep in his mind,
                                        until it forms a word.<br/><br/>
                                        Some people also use decoders, when learning or trying to improve the receiving speed. Decoders are software that transform the sounds into letters, but they&nbsp;
                                        fail a lot when the transmission is made by a human or there is too much noise on the frequency.&nbsp;
                                        Morse Code is an amazing mindfulness practice that helps alleviate anxiety.<br/><br/>

                                A callsign is an unique identifier of a properly licensed individual. To get a Amateur Radio callsign&nbsp;
                                you have to pass a test. This test is not hard and its goal is to make sure you are completely&nbsp;
                                capable of operating your equipment and making sure that you understand the ethical aspects of operating an&nbsp;
                                Amateur Radio station.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Depending on the radio waves propagation conditions, you can be heard in the entire planet ...&nbsp;
                                so avoiding talking about religion and politics is a good example of ethics in Amateur Radio.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A callsign has the information of your location plus a few letters you can choose.&nbsp;
                                Example: VE2ZDX , means:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>VE:</b> code for Canada</li>
                                    <li><b>2:</b> Quebec</li>
                                    <li><b>ZDX:</b> letters chosen by the callsign owner</li>
                                </ul>
                                Another example: PP5AX
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>PP:</b> code for Brazil</li>
                                    <li><b>5:</b> State of Santa Catarina</li>
                                    <li><b>AX:</b> letters chosen by the callsign owner</li>
                                </ul>
                                A country can have more than one "code". Canada can be VE, VA, VO, etc... Brazil can be PU, PP, PR, PY, etc..
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When we do a contact we can go to some websites where Amateur Radio Operators themselves&nbsp;

                            <p>The equipment necessary to practice this hobby is basically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Transceiver:</b> a Radio that is able to listen and transmit. Your FM radio only receives radio frequencies, this one can also transmit.</li>

                                <li><b>Power supply:</b> 12 volts battery or a power supply that outputs 12 volts.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                These equipments are not very expensive, they cost about the same of a cell phone.
                                But there's a problem with them: they are very hard to sell (practically impossible if you're not an Amateur Radio Operator).
                                Thus, Amateur Radio Operators are very careful when choosing/buying their equipment.

                                The good thing about them is that a Radio from 1950 does the same thing that a new top-of-the-line radio does.&nbsp;
                                Of course, it's nice to have a pretty and modern radio with all the filters, but in essence they do the same thing.&nbsp;
                                What really matters is the antenna.
